# Code Challenge: Class 01

# Reverse an Array


Write a function that reverses an array, in place

Be careful of: empty arrays, arrays with only 1, odd numbered count, even numbered count
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- Identify the start and end of the array (0 and length -1)
- Swap the arr[start] with arr[end]
- Move Start forward by 1
- Move End backwards by 1
- Repeat while start <= end

# Code Challenge: Class 02

#  Array-shift

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
The array-shift  removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element and This method changes the length of the array

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
create a function that takes an array and a value as input and then find the middle point of the index by using for loop and ceil.Maths to round up the middle number to integer .

# Code Challenge: Class 03

# array-binary-search
 #### Feature Tasks
- Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
- NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Approach & Efficiency
- Begin with an interval covering the whole array.
- Create a left pointer at the start of the array and a right pointer at the end of the array.
- Loop over and over the array.
- If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.
- Otherwise narrow it to the upper half.
- Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
