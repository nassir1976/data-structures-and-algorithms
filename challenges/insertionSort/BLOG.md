## Insertion Sort
### Pseudocode
          InsertionSort(int[] arr)
  
            FOR i = 1 to arr.length
    
              int j <-- i - 1
              int temp <-- arr[i]
      
             WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
               arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
               j <-- j - 1
        
             arr[j + 1] <-- temp
- arr = [ 8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]
- step 1: i starts from 1 and j starts from 0 and Temp is 4

- and check the array again

- step 2: i starts from 2 and j starts from 1 and temp is 23

- and check the array again

- step 3: i starts from 3 and j starts from 2 and temp is 42

- and check the array again

- step 4: i starts from 4 and j starts from 3 and temp is 16

- and check the array again

- step 5: i starts from 5 and j starts from 4 and temp is 15

- and check the array again
